# Risk of Rain 2 Modding
Hopefully interesing Risk of Rain 2 modding endeavors.
 
# Mods
## CommandChanges
Changes the Command artifact to allow cleansing pools to spawn. I used [Harmony](https://github.com/BepInEx/HarmonyX/wiki) for this.


## MoreArtifacts
Adds more artifacts to the game! Everyone must have the mod in multiplayer. There will be more artifacts when my friends or I come up with more ideas.
### Artifacts:
- Artifact of the Congregate:\
    Monsters can combine to form larger, stronger monsters. 
    Get them close to eachother and have fun (or not)!
- Artifact of the Conglomerate:\
    A random character on the same team will take damage instead of the one that is damaged.

## How to install
Use a mod manager OR...
1. Download the mod you want to install from the releases section or from [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/).
2. Extract the zip file.
3. Find the dll in the extracted folder.
4. Put the dll in the plugins folder of BepInEx in your Risk of Rain 2 install folder.

Enjoy!
