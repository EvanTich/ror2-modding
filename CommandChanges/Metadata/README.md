## CommandChanges
Changes the Command artifact to allow cleansing pools to spawn. I used [Harmony](https://github.com/BepInEx/HarmonyX/wiki) for this.

## How to install
Use a mod manager OR...
1. Download the mod you want to install from the releases section or from [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/).
2. Extract the zip file.
3. Find the dll in the extracted folder.
4. Put the dll in the plugins folder of BepInEx in your Risk of Rain 2 install folder.

Enjoy!
