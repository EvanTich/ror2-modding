# Example Artifact
This is an example artifact for anybody to use as a starting point for creating their own artifacts.

The only thing that is needed for the solution is your own libraries folder.
See [the very useful guide at R2Wiki](https://github.com/risk-of-thunder/R2Wiki/wiki/%5BIn-depth%5D-First-mod) if you need any help.
Just drag and drop the latest version of [MoreArtifacts](https://thunderstore.io/package/EvanTich/MoreArtifacts/) into your libraries folder and add it as a project reference.

Enjoy creating!
