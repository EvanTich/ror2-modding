## MoreArtifacts
Adds more artifacts to the game! Everyone must have the mod in multiplayer. There will be more artifacts when my friends or I come up with more ideas.
### Artifacts:
- Artifact of the Congregate:
    Monsters can combine to form larger, stronger monsters. Get them close to eachother and have fun (or not)!
- Artifact of the Conglomerate:
    A random character on the same team will take damage instead of the one that is damaged.
- Artifact of Confusion:
    All damage is randomized, even to the point of healing instead of hurting. I'll probably add more to make this one even more confusing.

## Want to create your own artifact?
Have some coding experience and want to create your own artifact but you don't know where to start? Check out the [example artifact project](https://github.com/EvanTich/ror2-modding/tree/master/ExampleArtifact) on Github. It shows you an easy to use example that you can use to jump-start your artifact endeavours.

## How to install

1. Download the mod you want to install from the releases section or from [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/).
